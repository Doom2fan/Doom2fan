## Bio
I am Chronos Ouroboros, also known as phantombeta.

I'm a hobbyist programmer from Brazil. I've primarily been involved in video game related projects such as Doom source ports and mods.  

## Interests
My primary interests are video games and programming. I listen to music during most of my time, as I find being in silence annoying and sometimes painful as I suffer from tinnitus.
I am also a furry, and I love scaly creatures like dragons, kobolds and snakes 🐍. Also sharks! 🦈

<summary>Programming</summary>

One of the main things I like to spend my time on. I've worked on many personal projects, though I've not released many projects, nor made any would call *complete*, until recently with the Ouroboros Industries, my collection of modules for VCV Rack 2.

I quite enjoy game engine and graphics programming, though I have not released any such projects yet.

My language of choice is C#. It find it strikes a very good balance between performance, safety and flexibility nowadays.  
.NET's JIT allows for some very interesting and useful optimizations that aren't possible with AOT compilation, and allows use of the CPU's full feature set.  
Unfortunately, my C# projects have largely all stalled for different reasons, so I've not had the chance to use C# in a while.

I've used C++ from time to time, though I don't find it very pleasant to use, particularly with less modernized codebases.  
In the past I've made many contributions to [GZDoom](https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom), a modernized, FOSS port of the 90s game Doom, and other games made in its engine.  
I've used C++ more frequently as of lately, as I've been working on "Ouroboros Industries", a collection of modules for VCV Rack 2, which only provides C++ interfaces for plugins.

My preferred language in the past was D. However, due to the lack of good tooling and libraries, along with a slow GC, I have not used it in years.  
However, despite not using it anymore, I'm still fond of it for its blend of flexibility and powerful compile-time capabilities.

<summary>Video games</summary>

I like to play and mod video games on PC, particularly FPS games like classic Doom, though I also enjoy many other genres of games.

I've spent quite a lot of my time playing and modding the original Doom game and its direct sequels. One of the projects below is one such mod I've made.

<summary>Music</summary>

I listen to quite a lot of metal and rock, and some types of electronic music. I also listen to many other genres though, particularly with music from my country.

Some of my favourite bands are Nightwish, Tool, Muse, Depeche Mode, Radiohead and Blackbriar, though I have many more favourites.

I've tried my hand at making some of my own music with VCV Rack 2, a virtual Eurorack system, but I've not yet made anything of note.
