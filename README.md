## Bio
I am Chronos Ouroboros, also known as phantombeta.

I'm a hobbyist programmer. I've primarily been involved in video game related projects such as Doom source ports and mods.

## Interests
### Programming
One of the main things I like to spend my time on. I've worked on many personal projects, though I've not released many projects, nor made any would call *complete*, until recently with the Ouroboros Industries, my collection of modules for VCV Rack 2.

I quite enjoy game engine and graphics programming, though I have not released any such projects yet.

My language of choice is C#. It find it strikes a very good balance between performance, safety and flexibility nowadays.  
.NET's just-in-time (JIT) compilation allows for some very interesting and useful optimizations that aren't possible with ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation, along with allowing use of the CPU's full feature set.  
Unfortunately, my C# projects have largely all stalled for different reasons, so I've not had a chance to use C# in a while.

I've used C++ from time to time, though I don't find it very pleasant to use, specially with less modernized codebases.  
My primary use of it in the past was through many contributions to [GZDoom](https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom), a modernized, FOSS port of the 90s game Doom, and other games made in its engine.  
I have had to use C++ more frequently as of lately, as I've been working on "Ouroboros Industries", a collection of modules for VCV Rack 2, which only provides C++ interfaces for plugins.

My preferred language in the past was D. However, due to the lack of good tooling and libraries, along with a suboptimal GC, I have not used it in years.  
However, despite not using it anymore, I'm still fond of it for its blend of flexibility and powerful compile-time capabilities.

### Video games
I like to play and mod video games on PC, particularly FPS games like classic Doom, though I also enjoy many other genres of games.

I've spent quite a lot of my time playing and modding the original Doom game and its direct sequels. One of the projects below is one such mod I've made.

### Furry
I'm also a furry, and I love scaly creatures like dragons, kobolds and snakes 🐍. Also sharks! 🦈
